What I learned:

-Wrote semantic, accessible HTML5 (proper structure, alt text, fragment links).

-Styled the page with an external CSS file and kept it responsive with max-width:100%.

-Used both local and remote images while keeping file paths organized.

-Added internal navigation that jumps to each section without JavaScript.

-Deployed the site live with GitHub Pages for the first time.
