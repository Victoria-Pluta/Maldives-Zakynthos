<h2>Crystal waters, hidden caves, and island life through my eyes.</h2>
<p>“Zakynthos is known as the Greek Maldives for its turquoise waters, white beaches, and dramatic cliffs. It’s a place where nature feels alive, and every corner has a story.”</p>

<h2 id="Navagio">Navagio (Shipwreck Beach)</h2>
<p>Navagio is the image everyone knows — bright turquoise water, white cliffs, and the<br>famous shipwreck lying in the middle of the sand. You can only reach it by boat, and when<br>you arrive, the whole place feels unreal, like a painting. The water is so clear it almost<br>glows. Even if it’s crowded in summer, the view is unforgettable.</p>

<h2 id="blue-caves">Blue Caves</h2>
<p>The Blue Caves are a world of their own. Sunlight enters the caves and turns the water<br>deep blue, almost electric. Boats move slow there, so you can feel the cool air and see the<br>colors change on the rock walls. If you visit early in the morning, you’ll have the calm,<br>magical blue all to yourself.</p>

<h2 id="porto-limionas">Porto Limnionas</h2>
<p>Porto Limnionas is a natural cove hidden between high rocks. The water is crystal clear and<br>deep, perfect for swimming and jumping from the cliffs. There’s no sand — just rock, sea,<br>and the smell of wild herbs. It’s one of the places where the island feels untouched, like<br>nature kept it for herself.</p>

<h2 id="turtle-spotting">Turtle Spotting (Caretta-caretta)</h2>
<p>Zakynthos is home to the famous Caretta-caretta sea turtles. You can often see them near<br>Laganas Bay, moving slowly under the water or coming up for air. The island protects them<br>carefully, because they nest on the beaches during summer. Watching a turtle swim next<br>to your boat is one of the most peaceful and special moments you can experience here.</p>

<h3>“Zakynthos is more than a summer destination. It’s a rhythm, a feeling, a home for those who let the sea guide them.”</h3>
